Rain and Precipitation: Desert areas like Atacama, Chile, can go decades without measurable rainfall.
Rain and Precipitation: Rain can sometimes contain dust, giving it a reddish color, known as "blood rain."
Rain and Precipitation: Raindrops can vary in size from 0.02 inches to 0.2 inches in diameter.
Rain and Precipitation: The heaviest rainfall ever recorded was in Foc-Foc, Réunion, where 71.8 inches fell in 24 hours.

Hurricanes and Storms: Hurricanes can release energy equivalent to 10 atomic bombs per second.
Hurricanes and Storms: The deadliest hurricane in history was the Great Hurricane of 1780, killing around 22,000 people.
Hurricanes and Storms: The term “hurricane” is used in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, while “typhoon” is used in the Western Pacific.
Hurricanes and Storms: A hurricane’s eyewall is where the most intense winds and rainfall occur.
Hurricanes and Storms: The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale categorizes hurricanes into five levels based on wind speeds.

Wind and Tornadoes: The strongest tornado ever recorded had winds estimated at 302 mph in Oklahoma in 1999.
Wind and Tornadoes: Tornadoes can occur in all continents except Antarctica.
Wind and Tornadoes: Wind speeds during a tornado can be so strong that they lift houses off their foundations.
Wind and Tornadoes: Dust storms, like the ones in the Sahara, can travel thousands of miles across oceans.
Wind and Tornadoes: The fastest recorded wind speed on Earth was 254 mph during Cyclone Olivia in Australia.

Snow and Ice: Snowflakes come in countless designs, and no two are alike.
Snow and Ice: The largest snowflake ever recorded was 15 inches wide and 8 inches thick.
Snow and Ice: Icebergs can contain trapped air bubbles that are thousands of years old.
Snow and Ice: Greenland’s ice sheet holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by 20 feet if it melted completely.
Snow and Ice: The record snowfall in a single year occurred in Mt. Baker, USA, with 95 feet of snow.

Clouds and Sky Phenomena: Mammatus clouds look like pouches hanging beneath the base of a cloud.
Clouds and Sky Phenomena: Lenticular clouds are lens-shaped and often mistaken for UFOs.
Clouds and Sky Phenomena: Red skies at sunrise and sunset are caused by scattering of light by dust particles.
Clouds and Sky Phenomena: The highest clouds in the atmosphere, called noctilucent clouds, occur at altitudes of 50 miles.
Clouds and Sky Phenomena: The rare "Green Flash" phenomenon happens briefly at sunrise or sunset.

Seasons and Climate: Winter storms can bring "thundersnow," where thunder and lightning occur during snowfall.
Seasons and Climate: Global warming has caused average sea levels to rise by 8 inches since 1880.
Seasons and Climate: Tropical cyclones draw energy from warm ocean water, thriving in areas of high humidity.
Seasons and Climate: The Antarctic ozone hole is larger than the area of North America.
Seasons and Climate: In desert climates, temperatures can drop by more than 50°F between day and night.

Earth and Weather Interactions: Volcanic eruptions can inject ash and gases into the stratosphere, affecting global weather.
Earth and Weather Interactions: El Niño can cause wetter-than-normal conditions in South America and droughts in Australia.
Earth and Weather Interactions: La Niña is the opposite phase of El Niño, leading to cooler and wetter global patterns.
Earth and Weather Interactions: The Coriolis effect influences wind patterns and storm rotations.
Earth and Weather Interactions: The atmosphere contains about 5,000 trillion tons of air!
